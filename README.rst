tidynamics
==========

A tiny package to compute the dynamics of stochastic and molecular simulations.

tidynamics depends only on `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ and `NumPy
<http://www.numpy.org/>`_ and performs the computation of

- Mean-square displacements
- Correlation functions

tidynamics accepts as input NumPy arrays storing the positions and velocities of particles.
